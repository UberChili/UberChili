## About Me
Hello! My name is Andrés, but you can call me Andrew if it's comfortable for you, I don't mind. I'm a junior software engineer, interested mainly in backend and systems programming. I am currently expanding my knowledge by studying Rust, C++ and Go, among some other things. I have experience with C, Python, Flask, and SQLite3.
